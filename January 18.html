<b>Why is your team running?</b>
We believe that our collective and diverse experiences will enable us to govern the AMS in a way that works for the student body.  In our time at Queen’s, we’ve recognized that there are a number of both student demographics and Faculty Societies that feel disenfranchised at our university.  In order for the AMS to truly fulfill its mission statement to serve and represent the diversity of students at Queen’s, a top-down government reform is necessary.  We sincerely need a more equitable representation of these students’ interests in the AMS.  This is the principle reason Team BGP is running for AMS Executive.<br><br>
 
<b>What can students expect from your team during the campaign?</b>
Students can expect Team BGP to take an honest and respectful approach to our opponents.  These are six individuals we are very much proud to run with so you will never see us swinging for knees.  We are confident and incredibly exited to share our platform with students we feel our ideas fully speak for themselves.  We feel deeply that our platform’s four pillars of Health, Wellness and Safety, New and Improved AMS Services, Academics and Employment, and Supporting Student Life offer a strong vision and carefully laid course for the AMS.<br><br>

 

<b>What is one thing students would be surprised to find out about your team?</b>
Students would be surprised that our poster photos were taken in Peter's bathtub, because that's where the lighting was best at the time!

				<b>Lisa Acchione (Vice President of University Affairs Candidate):</b> SONAD, SDARB <br> VP Discipline (MCRC 2011)<br><br>

				<b>Why is your team running?</b>

				We are running to make the AMS become more representative of its membership. We understand the disenfranchisement prevailing amongst students; this comes from an internal culture that promotes objectives that are not necessarily important to the greater student membership. We want to make the AMS more relevant to students.<br><br>

				<b>What can students expect from your team during the campaign?</b>

				Honesty. A comprehensive platform with points that are relevant to all members of the AMS. We will focus on affordability of your degree, mental and physical health issues and making the AMS more sustainable – to name a few.<br><br>

				<b>What is one thing students would be surprised to learn about your team?</b>

				Our 20-point contract where we promise part of our salary (5%) for every promise we “break”!

We are running as a team because we fundamentally believe that the AMS should be putting students first. The student body and AMS are faced with an array of challenges and it is incumbent upon an AMS Executive to advocate on their behalf and provide students with enriching opportunities.
