		<hr>
		<br>
		<p style="text-align: left, justify;">Overall, Team BGP has identified the need to increase accessibility to student resources in their platform. Their platform initiatives, which focus on expanding and integrating AMS services, are intended to provide a solution to problems within the AMS government structure. Eril Berkok, Peter Green and TK Pritchard – Team BGP – said their own experiences within and external to the AMS gives them greater ability to provide more accountability and accessibility to students. These are a few noteworthy initiatives that they hope will help achieve these goals: <br><br>
•	Expanding the Blue Light safety initiative into the University District. The team plans on running a pilot project in Victoria and City Park by summer 2013, with the eventual goal to expand the system throughout the student housing area and provide safety lights or panic buttons in parking lots and bus stops. This aim will help increase student safety in vulnerable areas off-campus, and according to Team BGP has support from Student Affairs. <br>
•	Increasing The Health and Dental Plan coverage to include contraception, physiotherapy and mental health counselling. The team will also send out a marketing survey to determine what students value in the Plan, with the goal to increase coverage for those areas. <br>
•	Introducing LGBTQ Thursdays at Alfies. This event will help represent and serve sexual diversity at Queen’s and provide a safe space for LBGTQ students. This proposal will be the first of its kind initiated by the AMS and will be held monthly.<br>
•	Creating an online database that will house course syllabi, with the possibility of indicating which courses include exams or quizzes. This initiative will be modeled after Exambank and will help students determine which courses they would prefer to take prior to enrolment. <br>
•	Expanding Queen’s Wi-Fi into the University District. The team will partner with Queen’s Information Technology Services to expand Internet coverage into off-campus housing. The team will initiate a survey to determine which areas will provide the most coverage, with the goal to provide coverage for all students who live off-campus. <br>
•	Undertaking a structural review of the AMS government to help streamline and maximize its efficiency. This will be done by forming a working group featuring the AMS Executive, the AMS Information Officer and members of the society, with the goal to shift government culture to long-term planning. The Team will re-evaluate stances taken by the AMS toward external organizations, such as Ontario Government and Queen’s administration to ensure student’s opinions are being reflected. <br><br>

		<h2 align="center"> PLATFORM PDA</h2>
		<hr>
		<br>
			<p style="text-align:left,justify;">Over the course of 72 pages, PDA details their plans for sweeping reforms throughout the AMS, seeking to reverse what they identify as a trend of indifferent executive leadership and make Queen’s student government more accountable to the students they govern.<br><br>

PDA’s platform is predicated on a 20-point action plan, ranging from financial accessibility to health care, the elimination of wasteful or inefficient fees from the AMS budget and increased transparency within the student government. The team has pledged a 5 per cent kickback on each of their salaries for each point they fail to accomplish during their year in office. <br><br>

The primary tenets of PDA’s platform include:<br><br>

•	Scrapping needless funds: Eliminating “discretionary” and “transition” funds from the AMS budget, which are generally directed to AMS staff retreats and other “elaborate parties.”<br>
•	Making mental and physical health care accessible: Increasing insurance coverage for students that need prescription drugs or psychiatric counseling, as well as devoting more resources to the AMS’ Social Issues Commission and the University’s Health Counseling and Disability Services.<br>
•	Promoting the students’ voice in government: Holding monthly town hall meetings to discuss student issues in an informal setting and creating the Ombudsperson position to represent all students within the AMS.<br>
•	Flexible hiring policies for AMS services: Creating a roster of reserve employees for retail and food services, to generate more temporary employment opportunities for students during peak business periods.<br>
•	Revisiting relationship with Athletics & Recreation: Reducing the Athletics student fee and splitting it into a mandatory and an opt-out component, giving students the option of rejecting certain A&R services.<br>
•	Improving SOLUS: Working with the university to establish online wait lists for courses and to allow students to opt out of AMS fees directly on SOLUS. <br>
•	Prioritizing clubs: Instating a $5 opt-out fee to finance the AMS Club Grants Fund and moving the Clubs Office to the authority of the Campus Activities Commission (CAC).<br><br>

		<hr>

		<br>

					<p style="text-align: left, justify;">Throughout their platform, team TNL identifies lobbying for change and increasing AMS communication to students as the primary methods in which they will achieve their platform goals. Troy Sherman, Nicola Plummer and Liam Faught — team TNL — said they will use their diverse experiences, loyalty and appreciation for Queen’s to shape their vision. Four focus areas became the framework of the platform to form their plans and ideas. These are a few key highlights of their platform that are worth noting and will shape their time as AMS Executives should students vote them in. <br>
•	They look to spearhead a major building project as they envision the connection of the Queen’s Centre and the JDUC by a bridge. With this project they aim to create more social space for students and facilitate a safer route than the current route through the loading dock area in the JDUC offers. They believe this is a priority for AMS executives and they hope to promote the JDUC as a student friendly space on campus. <br>
•	They believe in an “interdisciplinary approach to education” and therefore are proposing a Personal Interest Credit (PIC) which is graded on a pass/fail basis. They said they will work to sell the merits of this idea to the various governing university bodies and believe this idea will eliminate the stress that is related to students taking courses outside their fields.<br>
•	They see a need for the AMS to have a comprehensive plan on health and wellness  and look to implement a Health and Wellness Team that will help to make a happier and healthier student body. This team will organize outreach initiatives and workshops promoting healthy living. <br>
•	Close to 82 per cent of all first-year students at Queen’s own a smartphone, cited team TNL in their platform. Along with other social media initiatives, the team plans to launch an AMS Application to stay connected with students and keep them informed by making services and opportunities easily accessible.<br>
•	Homecoming is a focus for TNL as they fully support its return and look to facilitate events with alumni and students as well as a partnership with the City and our community neighbors. Team TNL envisions a successful Homecoming that continues far into the future. <br>
•	Increased enrollment is also something TNL addresses and will advocate on behalf of Queen’s students to the Provost’s and Principal’s Office.. TNL looks to plan ahead for this increase so that the AMS can maintain the same level of service to all future and current students.<br><br>
