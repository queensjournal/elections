Team BGP, consisting of Eril Berkok for president, Peter Green for vice-president and TK Pritchard for vice-president of university affairs, said it’s their diverse backgrounds that brought them together.<br><br>

Berkok, a member of University Senate and the Academic Task Force, is from Kingston. Working on a computer science degree, Berkok, ArtSci ’12 has spent a summer interning at IBM and another doing research for the EQUIS lab, and is a co-instructer for MATH 111. <br><br>

Berkok first approached Pritchard after considering running for AMS president.<br><br>

“I happened upon TK who was the internal experience that really strengthened and complemented me because I didn't have the internal knowledge about how the AMS works,” Berkok said.<br><br>

Being heavily involved with the AMS Social Issues Commission since his first year, Pritchard, ArtSci ’12 was a member of AMS Council and worked under the direct supervision of the vice president of university affairs  as Chair of the Commission last year. <br><br>

Pritchard also participate in Frosh Week as a Gael and chaired Queen’s Pride Project. He was nomiated for a Positive Space Award after chairing the Education on Queer Issues Project and working as a member of Performance Outreach for Student’s Social Education. <br><br>

With Pritchard on board, the duo then approached Green. <br><br>

“What he brings to the table is extremely valuable to our team,” Berkok added. “I've been an arms distance from the AMS, TK’s been within and Peter provides that external perspective that really complements our team.” <br><br>

A volunteer at SHRC, Green has spent two years working as a Banking Officer at Sociabank and sat on the Board of Directors for Union Gallery. Originally from Toronto, Green said his experience on exchange in the Netherlands helped him transform and greater understand differing perspectives. <br><br>

 He said that his and Pritchard’s opposing ideas work well together. <br><br>
 
“He will call us out whenever we’re saying things that are super AMS-y,” Pritchard said. “It really helped us translate our platform and our ideas to students better.” <br><br>

Team PDA is composed of Alexander Prescott, the presidential candidate; Craig Draeger, the vice president of operations candidate; and Lisa Acchione, the vice president of university affairs candidate.<br><br>

Prescott is a third-year biochemistry student from Sudbury, Ont. He’s currently a member of the Student Life Centre Council and serves as an ASUS Rep to the AMS. A former member of Queen’s Model United Nations, Prescott has also served on ASUS’ Special Initiatives Grant Committee.<br><br>

“[AMS president is] a position that requires depth of character for a person that’s able to handle many different situations coming at them, and to liaise with many different individuals and bodies at the same time,” Prescott, ArtSci ’14 said. “It requires a type of skill set that I feel I could bring to the table – one that requires deep character.”<br><br>

Draeger, a fourth-year philosophy and political studies student from Thunder Bay, Ont., has held a variety of positions within the AMS, including his current role as an elected student director on the AMS Board of Directors and previous experience as the Clubs Manager in 2011-12. Draeger, ArtSci ’13 also has journalistic experience as a former Copy Editor and Opinions Editor for the Journal and as the co-chair of the Queen’s Media and Journalism Conference in 2012. <br><br>

“I decided to run because of the number of things I saw in the AMS that weren’t working for students the way that they should,” Draeger said. “It needs to be a two-way street in which [the AMS and students] are both projecting and receiving information.”<br><br>

Acchione, is a third-year philosophy and english literature student from Caledon, Ont. She’s gained extensive experience in Queen’s residences as a residence facilitator and as the vice president of discipline for the Main Campus Residents’ Council (MCRC). Acchione has contributed to a number of committees within the MCRC, the AMS and Queen’s Senate, currently serving as a member on the Senate Committee on Non-Academic Discipline.<br><br>

“I was able to be a vice president of a smaller society, but a society that nonetheless has a partnership with the AMS,” Acchione said. “I’ve had a variety of experiences that I think really relates to this position.”

Team TNL, comprised of Troy Sherman, Nicola Plummer and Liam Faught, said they created a feasible platform and strive for stronger student communication. <br><br>

Sherman, of Ottawa, is running for president and studying political studies. He is currently the Municipal Affairs Commissioner for the AMS. Sherman, ArtSci ’14 has also had experience working as a first-year intern to the business manager at the Journal, Deputy Commissioner to the Municipal Affairs Commission and an intern in the Office of the Premiere. His connections and network will help in the role of president, he said.  <br><br>

Sherman met Faught this past year in the AMS. Faught, also a political studies student hailing from Ottawa, is looking to be elected as vice-president of university affairs. He’s the current Commissioner of Internal Affairs at the AMS. Faught, ArtSci ’14 also has experiences as an intern to the Judicial Affairs Director, as a Common Ground barista and as a deputy in the AMS Judicial Affairs Office.  <br><br>

The team came together after Faught and Sherman had decided to run together and approached Plummer about running for AMS Executive with the pair.  <br><br>

Plummer, a commerce student originating from Toronto, hopes to fill the vice-president of operations role. She’s currently the president of the Commerce Society and looks to bring a new view to the role. She has had extensive involvement in ComSoc as an intern to the VP External, Sponsorship Coordinator for Board Meeting and the Queen’s Leadership, Excellence and Development Conference and as a Volunteer Coordinator Queen’s Commerce Initiative Abroad.  <br><br>

Plummer, Comm ’13 had plans to defer a job offer to travel for a year, and told Faught she would think about the idea, but her previous plans quickly changed. <br><br>

After some discussion, Plummer announced her decision to Faught at the John Orr dinner.  <br><br>

“I pulled Liam aside and said ‘I’m in - I’ve decided I’m going to run for AMS Executive’ and he just paused and looked at me and said ‘Good for you... Like, with me?’ and I said ‘Yes, with you! Why [else] would I be telling you this?’” joked Plummer. <br><br>
