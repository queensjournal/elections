			<hr><br>

The lower ceilidh of the JDUC hosted a debate between the candidates running for undergraduate student trustee last night.<br><br>

The position, requires a two-year commitment and grants voting privileges on the Board of Trustees — one of the governing bodies at Queen’s. About 30 people were in attendance at the debate as the candidates discussed how they plan to increase opportunities for students and improve the University’s budget.<br><br>

Early on in the two-hour debate the candidates were asked a question about whether they support Principal Daniel Woolf’s reappointment for a five-year term.<br><br>

Andrew Aulthouse, ArtSci ’15, said he believes Woolf’s leadership has gained Queen’s a reputation internationally.<br><br>

“He can lead us to a better university by completing the Queen’s Centre project,” he said. “I also think his focus on the international school is the kind of leadership we need.” Leo Erlikhman, ArtSci ’15, commented on Woolf’s direct confrontation of the issues.
<br><br>
“If we look at his overall quality of a leader, he took us out of fiscal issues, restored Homecoming, restored our reputation, and created the initiation campaign.”<br><br>

Nathan Utioh, ArtSci ’15, said he was impressed with the Principal’s outreach to the students.
<br><br>
“He has a social media presence,” he said. “He takes his vision and reaches out into the community.” Following that question, the candidates were asked what they think is the greatest challenge currently facing Queen’s.
<br><br>
In his response, Aulthouse focused on the budget plan that the Board of Trustees approves annually. Faculty should get the pension plans that they deserve without changing the budget enough to affect the student experience, he said.
<br><br>
Utioh told the crowd he thinks enrolment should be the focal point for improvment at Queen’s.
<br><br>
“As we continue to grow, we are putting the strain on our University,” he said. “Our University is too big and we don’t have the space to provide the space for new students.”
<br><br>
Erlikhman said he believes the focus should be on the student to faculty ratio and each accessibility in the classroom.
<br><br>
“Every room on campus needs to be accessible for any student with disabilities,” he said.
<br><br>
A prominent theme in the debate was for student involvement and on making students more familiar with what the undergraduate student trustee does.
<br><br>
“If we have 200 students engaged, that’s great, but 2,000 that’s better”, said Erlikhman.
<br><br>
Aulthouse agreed that the position isn’t well known.
<br><br>
Utioh said that the students that he met are “excited” to hear that they have such a significant voice at a high level upon learning about the position.<br><br>

The candidates all pledged to push the presence of the student trustee on campus and online. They also offered different solutions to the reality that only one student can hold the two-year term.<br><br>

Aulthouse said he understands that the Undergraduate Student Trustee may be a difficult position to fill alone but that he believes he is self-motivated and can handle the role.<br><br>

Erlikhman said he wants to look into other universities and see what they can implement at Queen’s, and compare what is or isn’t working.
<br><br>
Utioh wants to implement a first-year intern for the Undergraduate Student Trustee so they immediately can get involved with student government and hopefully influence others and give the students another person to approach to voice their concerns.
<br><br>
The night ended with Lauren Long, the present undergraduate student trustee, initiating the Oil Thigh as per tradition every year at the end of this debate.

		<br>

			<hr><br>

Mental health and overcrowded residences are a priority for Andrew Aulthouse if he’s elected to the position of undergraduate student trustee. He supports the idea of faculty-specific counsellor for academic stress related issues.
<br><br>
“That way you can deal with your academic stress through those councilors who are familiar with the unique circumstances within that faculty.”
<br><br>
Aulthouse, ArtSci ’15 said he was eager to focus on mental health after talking with the AMS Social Issues Commissioner Katie Conway, who brought up similar concerns. The Faculty of Law and School of Medicine each already have a staff member offering academic and non-academic support for their students. Additionally, Beamish Munro Hall has a satellite service of the Peer Support Centre for engineering students.
<br><br>
Aulthouse said making sure that students have a comfortable place to live ties in with his plan to improve mental health and student experience on campus.
<br><br>
He wants to ensure the University follows through on its promise to turn the common rooms that are currently housing students back into common rooms.
<br><br>
“They increase enrolment every year, [and] the job of the undergraduate student trustee will be to advocate that enrolment does not increase by the large increments that new residences could allow for.”
<br><br>
Aulthouse said his passion for student government was ignited during his first year at Queen’s, when he acted as a first-year intern to the president of the Arts and Science Undergraduate Society.
<br><br>
This year, he’s served as an Arts and Science representative on Senate and as a member of ASUS Assembly, the Non-Academic Discipline Committee and on Arts and Science Faculty Board.
<br><br>
“As the vice-chair on the ASUS Board of Directors, I got to approve their budget,” he said, “[which involves] overseeing the finances of the largest faculty budget on campus.”
<br><br>
Aulthouse said it was serving on Senate that convinced him to stay involved with student government.
<br><br>
After meeting with members of the Board of Trustees, including foerm ASUS President Rico Garcia and current Student Trustee Lauren Long, Aulthouse noted the similar ideas they shared, such as focusing on mental health, and incorporated them his platform. ***** <br><br>

		<img src="img/Leo_E1.jpg"><p>Leo Erlikhman plans to create a page on the University Secretariat website for feedback. (<a href="http://queensjournal.ca/author/alex-choi/">Alex Choi</a>)</p> <hr></div>

Leo Erlikhman believes the perspectives of Queen’s he’s gained as a tour guide and an ASUS representative to the AMS will aide him in making the best decisions possible as undergraduate student trustee, if elected. “I educate myself on everything that happens around this university,” Erlikhman, ArtsSci ’14, said.<br><br>

His major platform focus is opening up the way students can voice their opinion.
<br><br>
He wants to create a page on the University Secretariat website which will allow students to submit anonymous feedback.
<br><br>
“This would allow students to connect directly with the Board [of Trustees],” he said, adding that he’s seen a lot of passion from Queen’s students about issues on campus through channels such as editorials and forums.
<br><br>
He plans on creating a Facebook page aimed at students which will provide updates on the Board’s activities. Student feedback is especially important now that the administration will be revisiting the Campus Master Plan, which will act as a policy framework for the University over the next 10 to 15 years, he said. For him, both the short-term and long-terms needs of students are a priority.<br><br>

“We need to see what is good for students now and students 10 years from now,” he said. “For example, we are increasing the number of students that we have but our faculty ratio is at its lowest. These are the things that need to be addressed.”<br><br>

Erlikhman was inspired to run for the position through his campus involvement, which he believes provided him with an idea of what students applying to university look for. He said he knows what Queen’s has to offer and what it lacks.
<br><br>
Much of his insight came from his time as an ASUS rep, a position he held in his second year.<br><br>

“I love this school a lot and [holding the position of student trustee] would be the best way for me to contribute to the future,” Erlikhman said.<br><br>

		<img src="img/Nathan_U1.jpg"><p>Nathan Utioh hopes to establish a position for a first-year intern to the Student Trustee. (Alex Choi)  (<a href="http://queensjournal.ca/author/alex-choi/">Alex Choi</a>)</p> <hr></div>
Nathan Utioh plans to get students involved from the get go if he’s elected as the undergraduate student trustee.<br><br>

As someone who got involved in student government positions in first-year, he believes providing first-years especially with opportunities is essential.<br><br>

He plans to create a first-year intern position to the undergraduate student trustee in order for them to see how student government works.<br><br>

“If we can get the first-years involved, they will hopefully stay for another three years,” Utioh, ArtSci ’15 said. “Once you get involved, you want to stay involved.”
<br><br>
Utioh’s interest in the position began in his first year after he was elected as an ASUS representative to the AMS and sat on both the AMS and ASUS assemblies.
<br><br>
He also interned for Morgan Campbell, last year’s AMS President.
<br><br>
“Ever since I got exposed to the student level [of] governance, I wanted broaden how I can get more involved with the University,” Utioh said. He added that he feels first-year involvement is crucial to a successful student government, and the intern position he plans to create will facilitate this.
<br><br>
Utioh said many first-year students have a “tight knit“ group of friends whom they can recruit to get involved with the AMS.
<br><br>
To create increase participation among the student body, he plans to increase the student trustees’ presence on social media. He wants to enable the student community to voice their opinions on sites like Facebook and the AMS website.
<br><br>
In addition to this online presence, he also plans to host an informal open dialogue meetings for students to attend and voice their comments or questions. He hopes he can get the AMS involved as well.
<br><br>
“There will hopefully be an involvement the Rector, Student Senate Caucus Chair and the AMS executive,” he said.
<br><br>
He also hopes to seek out specific student groups for feedback and give them a chance to talk to him directly.
<br><br>
“I want to get to a few club meetings once a month, just stopping in and introducing myself and talking about the issues,” he said.

			<h6> Many major initiatives will be shaped by student responses to provide representation</h6>

		<br>

			<hr><br>

The biggest initiatives planned by team BGP’s presidential candidate Eril Berkok, vice-president of operations candidate Peter Green and vice-president of university affairs TK Pritchard will be shaped by student responses, the team members said.
<br><br>
Their 54-page platform focuses on expanding and integrating AMS services to provide greater accessibility and representation for students.
<br><br>
Other platform initiatives include expanding the blue light emergency phones and wireless internet around student housing, tailoring coverage in the AMS Health and Dental plan to student needs, as well as gathering mental health professionals to serve students on campus and creating a Student Mental Health Advisory Board, with the hope of increasing students’ accessibility to AMS resources on and off-campus.
<br><br>
Maintaining a critical eye over the internal operations of the AMS is vital to ensuring accountability and efficiency, Berkok, ArtSci ’12, said.
<br><br>
“We really want to do our due diligence and stand by students and really optimize the AMS to what they need,” he said. “[The AMS] has never actually evaluated its structure and what it does to represent students.”
<br><br>
Berkok is a member of University Senate and the Academic Task Force, and currently co-instructs a first-year math course.
<br><br>
According to Pritchard, the AMS needs to ensure that its presence extends to every student on campus.
<br><br>
“Students still don’t really know who [the AMS] is and what we do,” Pritchard, ArtSci ’12 said. “You have to reach out to those students and we need to be very clear that we want to hear from students who don’t like us, otherwise as a student leader you are being ineffective.”
<br><br>
He added that his passion for the position’s portfolio lead him to join Berkok after running for the same position last year with team GPP and losing to team JDL.
<br><br>
“I believe so strongly in this position that I’m willing to run and have lost and do it all over again,” he said. “When Eril came to see me, it took a lot of restraint to not say yes because I did love what we could do … despite the fact that I knew what it was like to not be successful.” Pritchard served as the Social Issues Commissioner last year, and has been involved with Education on Queer Issues Project and Queen’s Pride Project since he came to Queen’s. Green, who joined the team later, was approached by Berkok and Pritchard for his external perspective.
<br><br>
“I’m coming into this from the outside the fishbowl, not within,” he said. “I have a very accurate perspective of how students perceive the services and the AMS in general.”
<br><br>
“The diversity of perspectives in our team speaks to our self-critical nature,” Berkok said. “We are cognisant of AMS operations and how they are perceived … having that at the executive level would be tremendous.”
<br><br>
Green added that his experience outside of the AMS gives him greater perspective in handling its operations.
<br><br>
He worked as a Bank Manager at Scotia Bank, and is a member of the board at Union Gallery.
<br><br>
“Coming from an external perspective, I see that in years past the AMS seems to be an elite [group] and there are very few people who know what is happening within it,” Green, ArtSci ’13, said. “We need to make sure there aren’t any groups who feel marginalized or disenfranchised by the AMS.”<br><br>

PDA wants the AMS to listen.
<br><br>
Presidential candidate Alexander Prescott, vice president of operations candidate Craig Draeger, ArtSci ’13, and vice president of university affairs candidate Lisa Acchione, ArtSci ’14, say they’re running a different kind of campaign — one that’s intent on opening the student government to the needs of its constituents.
<br><br>
“[The AMS] is very good at projecting their ideas and their actions to the students, but if you question any of those actions, it feels as if you get gang-tackled sometimes,” Prescott, ArtSci ’14 said. “We want to change that culture.”
<br><br>
PDA isn’t purely external to the AMS — Prescott currently serves as an ASUS Representative and Draeger sits on the Board of Directors — but their campaign is predicated on reforms they’d like to see within the student government, starting from the top down.
<br><br>
“The three of us figured that the culture of the organization needs to change … so that students have an organization that can serve them better, and speak to the real issues that students are facing on campus,” Prescott said, citing mental health concerns, academic quality and increasing constraints on student housing as priorities.
<br><br>
PDA’s campaign is based on a 20-point action plan, focusing on slashing unnecessary expenditures from the AMS’ budget and returning funds to students.
<br><br>
Under PDA’s proposal, each member of the executive would kick back 5 per cent of their salary to the AMS for each point the team fails to accomplish. The success or failure of an ambiguous point would be determined by a vote in AMS Assembly at the end of the executive term.
<br><br>
“If we get nothing done during our year in office, then we make no money,” Prescott said.
<br><br>
Financial accessibility is a cornerstone of PDA’s campaign, highlighted by a proposed reduction to the mandatory $70.18 AMS Specific fee and increased insurance coverage for students that rely on prescription drugs or psychiatric counseling.
<br><br>
Alongside their 72-page platform, PDA released a proposed budget for every AMS service, commission, office and governing body, identifying roughly $160,000 in inefficient spending.
<br><br>
“I went into the expenses of every individual committee, and broke down what’s necessary and what’s completely superfluous,” Draeger said. “Most of that is things that I would simply call waste – vacations, discretionary funds that don’t need to be the size that they are.”
<br><br>
AMS Assembly currently allots $15,000 to “Discretionary Executive” funds. Draeger, the AMS’ Clubs Manager in 2011-12, said he believes these are often used to finance extravagant staff retreats during the summer and over transition weekends in April.
<br><br>
Tristan Lee, the current AMS vice-president of operations didn’t comment on PDA’s issue with the funds, but he said the funds are used in part for “staff development and appreciation throughout the year.” “Discretionary budgets and certain line items in the budget are some of the most dubious expenditures we see in the AMS,” Draeger said. “We’d eliminate this type of stuff.”
<br><br>
PDA’s commitment to transparency is not only financial, but also social. The team plans to introduce a publicly elected Ombudsperson to act as a liaison between the AMS and the general student body and schedule monthly town hall meetings to communicate with students directly.
<br><br>
Along with Acchione, current vice president of discipline of the Main Campus Residents’ Council, Prescott and Draeger believe their proposed structural reforms can return the AMS to relevance among the student body.
<br><br>
“When you juxtapose us with the other teams, I feel like we’ll be the ones bringing professionalism, reality and the leadership that students deserve from their student leaders,” he said. “We’ll be the better choice.”<br><br>

		<br>

			<hr><br>
Troy Sherman, Nicola Plummer and Liam Faught, the candidates behind TNL, are running on a self-described feasible platform, with a focus on informing and advocating for students.
<br><br>
Faught, ArtSci ’14, is the current AMS commissioner of internal affairs, and has spent the year working closely with Sherman, ArtSci ’14, current municipal affairs commissioner.
<br><br>
Plummer, Comm ’13, has extensive involvement in the Commerce Society, of which she is now president. She’s the first executive candidate from the ComSoc to run for AMS executive in five years.
<br><br>
“Win or lose, I hope that other students in the student body see that just because you’re not an Arts and Science student, the AMS is [still] a service for you,” vice-president of operations candidate Plummer said.
<br><br>
Attainability was important to the team in crafting their platform, Plummer said.
<br><br>
“We made sure we could do it before we wrote it down,” she said.
<br><br>
Many of their ideas involve lobbying for change and empowering students.
<br><br>
“Nothing is impossible,” Plummer said. “You just need to keep trying harder.”
<br><br>
Their platform ideas are grouped into four “focus areas”: opportunities, advocacy, accountability and accessibility.
<br><br>
“We built from the ground up,” vice-president of university affairs candidate Faught said. “We started talking about our platform points first and then started to realize that all of these points can fit under themes that are very important to us as individuals and should be important to the AMS.”
<br><br>
TNL plans to build a bridge between the JDUC and the Queen’s Centre using funds from the $1.2 million dollar JDUC Renovation Fund.
<br><br>
They hope it will create an easier, safer route for students to cross from one building to the other. A proposed new lounge area outside of the Tricolour Outlet and CoGro Express will also increase traffic between the buildings, they said.
<br><br>
Academic ventures in their platform include lobbying for a personal interest credit, which will allow students to take courses outside of their departments on a pass or fail basis. This is meant to encourage students who may be intimidated by courses in other areas of study, who would take them without fearing academic repercussions. Connecting with students is important to TNL, and social media is a major tool the team wishes to utilize; they hope to launch an AMS app, which will provide students with access to various student services and information all in one place, should they be elected.
<br><br>
Each member believes they each bring something different to the team and complement each other.
<br><br>
“We clicked, and that for me was the biggest thing—you have to have good team chemistry,” presidential candidate Sherman said. “You want to make sure you can work together and be friends together and we’ve done a very good job at that.”
<br><br>
The team members said they understand how the AMS works and will easily adapt to their new roles, should they be elected.
<br><br>
“You do it because you feel, genuinely, you have something else to offer. You do it for the society,” Sherman said. “You have the ideals, hopes and dreams of the student body at heart and it’s you job to voice them and advocate for them and find different solutions.”<br><br>

PDA wants the AMS to listen.
<br><br>
Presidential candidate Alexander Prescott, vice president of operations candidate Craig Draeger, ArtSci ’13, and vice president of university affairs candidate Lisa Acchione, ArtSci ’14, say they’re running a different kind of campaign — one that’s intent on opening the student government to the needs of its constituents.
<br><br>
“[The AMS] is very good at projecting their ideas and their actions to the students, but if you question any of those actions, it feels as if you get gang-tackled sometimes,” Prescott, ArtSci ’14 said. “We want to change that culture.”
<br><br>

The future of the Physical Education Centre (PEC) is under discussion after the three gyms at the Centre were reopened last week.
<br><br>
In December 2012, Bartlett, Bews and Ross gyms were reopened for exams. Further expansions and development for a health and wellness centre in the PEC have become platform points for some AMS executive candidates.
<br><br>
Last year, current AMS executives Johnson-Dineen-Lee (team JDL) lobbied for the reopening of the PEC.
<br><br>
Tristan Lee, vice president of operations, said this was one of their more contentious platform points.
<br><br>
“We found that it was definitely going to happen in the summer and we were just overjoyed that we were able to accomplish that piece [of our platform],” Lee, ArtSci ’12 said.
<br><br>
According to him, team JDL saw overwhelming student support for the project. This led to them working with Student Affairs who had also been interested in seeing the building reopen.
<br><br>
A proposal was then submitted to Provost and Vice Principal (Academic), Alan Harrison, after which Athletics and Recreation joined the effort.
<br><br>
“We thought that there’s obviously this huge desire for more intramurals space and [the reopening] seemed like a really logical solution,” Lee said.
<br><br>
The PEC, located on Union St. between University Ave. and Division St., was closed in 2009 after the opening of the Queen’s Centre — now home to Queen’s Athletics and Recreation.
<br><br>
The entire renovation cost was $1.4 million. Assessments and cost estimates began in Spring 2012 and work started in the following October.
<br><br>
So far, the gyms are open for exams and intramurals. They’ve been used for exams in previous years, but were later closed.
<br><br>
Prior to its opening, the building needed to be brought up to accessibility regulations. To “open,” or make the PEC accessible for all, could have cost up to $2 million.
<br><br>
The limestone-clad building was constructed in 1930-31 and cost just under $6 million.
<br><br>
Lee said it was concluded after the assessments that opening the entire building for Health, Counselling and Disability Services (HCDS) wasn’t financially viable due to costs of opening and renovations.
<br><br>
“There’s a lot of the building that’s still closed off,” Lee said.
<br><br>
Ann Tierney, associate vice-provost and dean of student affairs, said there are still a few cosmetic tweaks needed but the space is ready for exams and intramurals.
<br><br>
Just over 300 students can write exams in each of the three gyms at one time.
<br><br>
“It’s much easier to have large venues,” she said, adding that larger classes won’t be divided between exam rooms now.
<br><br>
Jeff Downie, associate director for business development and facilities for Athletics and Recreation, said since its opening the PEC has allowed the intramural waiting list for students to drop from 1,000 to zero.
<br><br>
He estimated that there are more than 6,000 students playing intramurals at Queen’s.
<br><br>
“When we hear from a student who comes to Queen’s and says, ‘Well I really wanted to play basketball but I didn’t get my team in on time,’ that’s probably the most disheartening for us,” he said.
<br><br>
The goal was to expand gym space to allow more opportunities for students, Downie said.
<br><br>
“We’ve got waiting lists in so many different areas, that if we can … expand it and add more teams then maybe we could start to look at new sports in the ARC or the PEC.” <br><br>

<b>BGP</b>
<br>
The possibility of using the PEC as a location for the impending Health and Wellness Centre is on Team BGP’s radar.
<br><br>
Team Berkok-Green-Pritchard (BGP) have met with both Principal, Daniel Woolf and Associate Vice Principal and Dean of Student Affairs, Ann Tierney to discuss its feasibility.
<br><br>
According to TK Pritchard, vice-president of university affairs candidate, the Health and Wellness Centre would be a viable location for an amalgamation of campus health services.
<br><br>
Moving health services to the PEC would mean more room for counselling and clinics, and a potential physiotherapy space.
<br><br>
Pritchard said the University estimates that the Health and Wellness Centre project will take between five and 10 years to establish.
<br><br>
While no development would happen next year if BGP were to be elected, they plan to work with the administration to make the project a priority for coming years.
<br><br>
The Centre would be developed in the parts of the PEC that are currently not in use.
<br><br>
“We have no interest in taking away from the athletics space,” Pritchard, ArtSci ’12, said. “This is the first time in a long time where there are no students on the [waiting] list for intramurals … and we have no interest in removing that.”

<b>TNL</b>
<br>
Due to students contributing fees for the Queen’s Centre, TNL doesn’t want students to pay for the reopening of the PEC.
<br><br>
Instead, the team plans to use alumni donations as a way of financing their plans.
<br><br>
TNL plans to engage student opinion on the use of alumni donations by using Facebook and other forms of social media.
<br><br>
A ‘Student’s Corner’ will also be added to the AMS executive newsletter to pose questions to students to identify their priorities when it comes to donations.
<br><br>
TNL hopes to establish a Health and Wellness team enforce campus health ideas, Liam Faught, vice-president of university affairs candidate, said.
<br><br>
“We want somewhere central on campus where students can go for health and wellness concerns … if that’s a priority that the University wants to bring forward then I think we’d be more than willing and very equipped to do that and partner up with them,” Faught, ArtSci ’14.
<br><br>
Presidential candidate Troy Sherman said he thinks a revitalized PEC will bring a new life to campus and normalize mental health issues to reduce stigma.
<br><br>
“By bringing it to campus I think it’s going to add to the discussion, it’s going to be a safe place where students can do and find resources and support,” Sherman, ArtSci ’14, said.

<b>PDA</b>
<br>
Craig Draeger, vice-president of operations candidate for team PDA, said they are concerned with increasing the functionality of what the campus already has.
<br><br>
“I think we envision the PEC as part of a broader Student Life Centre that demonstrates the most functionality for students,” Draeger, ArtSci ’13, said.
<br><br>
PDA said that as the PEC isn’t under the Operations and Management Agreement or the Shared Space Policy, the team has chosen to concentrate on the revitalization of the JDUC.
<br><br>
Renovations to the JDUC will be paid for out of the AMS’ capital contribution to the Queen’s Centre. Of the $10.6 million that the AMS contributed, $1.2 million was slated to go towards a JDUC rejuvenation project, said a 2012 Journal article.
<br><br>
“[For] us it’s about improving what we have, it’s about functionality of the JDUC for which maintenance was deferred for a decade in the run-up to the Queen’s Centre,” Draeger said.
<br><br>
He added that there are many problems with the JDUC, including sustainability issues.
<br><br>
“If I recall correctly, more power is used in the JDUC than [in the Queen’s Centre] even though it’s a much bigger complex because of how poorly insulated and how draughty the windows are,” Draeger said, adding that the recent retiling project was a good start but more improvement is needed, including lighting.
<br><br>
“We’re not interested in ‘glory projects’ — projects that we need to put a name onto,” Draeger said. “We’re interested in improving the nuts and bolts that make everything else possible.”

			<hr><br>

At Tuesday night’s vice president of university affairs debate, candidates each shared their teams’ priorities.
The debate took place in the Lower Ceilidh of the JDUC in front of a full crowd. <br><br>

TK Pritchard, BGP’s candidate, said his team’s main priority is student health and safety.
Pritchard spoke to a number of different initiatives in their platform, namely the expansion of the blue light system.
“It’s extremely important based on evidence that students are facing safety issues in Victoria and City Park,” Pritchard, ArtSci ’12, said. <br><br>
“Expanding blue lights to these areas could greatly increase student safety around the University District.”
Lisa Acchione, PDA’s candidate, agreed that a greater focus on student health is a priority for her team. 
Acchione, ArtSci ’14, said students currently face more than a two-week wait time to see Health, Counselling and Disability Services’ lone sexual abuse counsellor.<br><br>
“I think that is a tragedy,” Acchione said, noting that PDA plans to increase health care coverage for greater psychiatric help through HCDS and within Kingston.<br><br>
For team TNL’s Liam Faught, the AMS mission statement to “serve and represent the students at Queen’s” is their main priority. <br><br>
Tackling enrolment at the university will be where they start.  <br><br>
“While this is a broad issue, I think it is something we need to make a priority in the near future and I think it’s something team TNL is very well equipped to do with our experience,” Faught, ArtSci ’14 said. <br><br>
Homecoming, which was reinstated by Principal Daniel Woolf last December, was also a prominent debate topic, with all teams agreeing that sustaining the tradition is important to students. <br><br>
Team BGP will look to create different networking activities for students and alumni, Pritchard said. This would serve to displace the number of students on Aberdeen St.<br><br>
“We want to encourage our clubs to hold events on both weekends so they can connect with alumni,” he said. <br><br>
Acchione said that team PDA would encourage the AMS to play a role in increasing student involvement, either by providing opportunities for volunteers or by utilizing the Student Maintenance and Resource Team to facilitate clean-up efforts.<br><br>
“We want to ensure that this is an event we can have year after year,” she said. <br><br>
Faught said TNL has a great understanding of Homecoming since Sherman, the current Municipal Affairs Commissioner, sat on the Fall Reunion Working Group and saw the processes of reinstatement first hand. <br><br>
Scheduled programming like the Tricolour Run and networking events are some ideas that Faught offered.
“We want to see programming that does constructive things for students,” he said. <br><br>

			<hr><br>

The first half of what occurred in the JDUC on Tuesday night was unworthy of its official title. Debates typically include argument and in this portion of the evening no debate happened. Rarely did the candidates for Vice President of University Affairs address each other directly. Things only got interesting when the floor opened up for all team members to speak. To an extent, the candidates should be forgiven for their tame responses since the questions posed weren’t designed to provoke disagreement. <br><br>
Because the proceedings were so deficient, audience members were forced to judge the three candidates based on how eloquently they described the relevant portions of their platforms. On this score, team TNL’s Liam Faught came out on top. He remained businesslike and was the only candidate to stay completely unflustered by the questions posed by the moderator. <br><br>
That being said, it was team PDA and their candidate Lisa Acchione who most set themselves apart from the boilerplate rhetoric and generic platforms typical of political campaigning. Their emphasis on efficient student service and the reduction of fees mirrors Rob Ford’s campaign for the Toronto’s mayoralty. I don’t mean to denigrate PDA by making this association, but the parallels are undeniable. <br><br>
Team BGP’s TK Pritchard sometimes cut his answers short but was convincing when describing his capabilities as a manager. BGP seems to be the “social activist” team in the race. This team should present their platform more aggressively as they are a vital counterpoint to the visions for the AMS presented by the other two outfits.<br><br>
The second portion of the debate opened the floor to the candidates for all positions. Team PDA’s Alexander Prescott wasted no time in beginning an offensive against team TNL. His attacks criticized a perceived culture of “elitism” and waste within student government. While they seemed forced and occasionally vague, these barbs deserved a response. Unfortunately, team TNL never replied in any significant way. It seems that TNL was trying to stay above the fray and project an air of corporate indifference.<br><br>
 If forced to pick a winner, I would call the evening for team TNL. They succeeded in convincing me of their overriding competence and did a good job of making their experience relevant. Faught’s focus on expanding enrollment seemed logical in light of significant new developments at Queen’s. Hopefully the next two debates will bring more actual disagreement. <br><br>
